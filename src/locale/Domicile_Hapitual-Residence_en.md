This is the case, if you have a **_domicile_** or **_habitual residence_** in Austria.

Persons have a **_domicile_** in Austria if they have a dwelling in Austria which they will clearly use as such for a longer period of time. The dwelling does not have to be the main residence, but it must be suitable for living according to the personal circumstances. To establish a domicile, the dwelling must not be used continuously, but at least on a recurring basis.

Persons have a **_habitual residence_** in Austria if they stay in Austria not only temporarily (vacation, business trip, visit, etc.) but clearly for a longer period of time. In any case, after six months of residence in Austria, unlimited tax liability arises on a retroactive basis.
